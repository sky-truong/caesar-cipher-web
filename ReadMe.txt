Basic Caesar Cipher functions of encoding and decoding for a shift values.
Design idea is from https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher

Only the English language alphabet is accounted for at the moment.

Future improvement:
- Add a section where encoded text is entered and outputs the shift value used to encode the text
as well as the 'predicted' decoded text.
